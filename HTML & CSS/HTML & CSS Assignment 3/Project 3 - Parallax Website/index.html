            <h2>Mount Taranaki</h2>
            <p>Also known as Mount Egmont, Mount Taranaki is a quiescent stratovolcano on the western coast of the North Island. Its symmetrical shape gives it a strong resemblance to Japan’s Mount Fuji – so much so that Mount Taranaki served as the backdrop for the famous mountain in the Tom Cruise film The Last Samurai (2003). Hiking tracks around Egmont National Park provide access to this magnificent summit.</p>

            <h2>Lake Tekapo</h2>
            <p>During the day, Lake Tekapo dazzles with its bright-blue glacial waters. At night, the area becomes a stargazing haven, with the township, its stunning lake and the nearby Mount John Observatory all part of the South Island’s International Dark Sky Reserve. In spring, you’ve got another picturesque bonus: the lupins that colour the roadside in a carpet of purple and pink hues.</p>
